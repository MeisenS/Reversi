We use eclipse in this project. There are five classes in the folder and one readme. Class Reversi.java is the main class. Class Game.java is for setting up all the Reversi. Like how to move and generate the reversi board. Class searchAlgorithm is the interface. We did all the agents. Class randomSearch is implements the searchAlgorithm class.We also have 3 board sizes. Our project also shows the optimal moves and our exceptions can properly respond to your invalid input. We also shows the elapsed time. 

The first agent is to play randomly.
The second agent is to play with Heuristic-Minimax search with alpha-beta pruning .
